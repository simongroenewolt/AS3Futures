AS3 Futures is an effort to make a small set of classes to help handle asynchronous calls in AS3. The entry concept is the Future. This represents the outcome of an asynchronous action. Having a common interface to represent asynchronous actions allows the consumer of the interface to treat all async actions the same way.
